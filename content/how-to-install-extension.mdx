# How to Install the Extension

This guide explains how to install the extension manually in **Developer Mode** using the build folder provided. 

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- A Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave)
- The build folder (`build/`)

---

## 🔧 Step-by-step Instructions

### 1. Open Chrome Extensions Page

Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser and **enable Developer mode** from the top-right toggle.

### 2. Click “Load unpacked”

Click the **“Load unpacked”** button and select the folder where the extension is built (usually `build/` or `dist/` depending on your setup).

---

> 💡 Tip: Make sure the folder contains the `manifest.json` file — it's required to load the extension.

### 3. Extension Installed!

Once loaded, you should see the extension in the list.
