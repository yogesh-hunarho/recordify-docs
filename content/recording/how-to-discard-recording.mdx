# How to discard a recording

Cancelling a recording is simple. Here’s how.

Discarding a recording
<video  style={{ width: "100%",}} autoPlay loop muted playsInline >
  <source src="/video/delete-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

To start over, simply press on the Restart recording button on the toolbar. You will be prompted with a modal asking if you’re sure, since it will lose all your current video progress.

After pressing to continue restarting, you will see a countdown if you have it enabled, or you will start recording again automatically after a few seconds.
