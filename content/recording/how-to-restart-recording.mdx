# How to restart a recording

Makes it very simple to start over a recording at any time.

Restarting your recording
<video  style={{ width: "100%",}} autoPlay loop muted playsInline >
  <source src="/video/restart-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

To start over, simply press on the Restart recording button on the toolbar. You will be prompted with a modal asking if youâ€™re sure, since it will lose all your current video progress.

After pressing to continue restarting, you will see a countdown if you have it enabled, or you will start recording again automatically after a few seconds.
