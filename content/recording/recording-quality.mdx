# How to restart a recording

By default, It will try to record at 720p (or less, based on your device specifications). You can change this by following these steps:

<ImageZoom  src="/images/extension/change-resolution.png" alt="step 1" />

1. Open the Extensions popup.

2. Put your mouse over the popup, and then click on the “…” button on the top right.

3. Hover on “Max resolution” to reveal the different options

4. Choose what resolution you want to record in. Depending on your device, some of the options might be unavailable.

This will try to record at the resolution you select, however depending on the memory available (if you have a lot of applications or tabs open), the quality of the video could drop. 

You can select a lower resolution if you’d like to generate a smaller file size or consume less memory while recording.
