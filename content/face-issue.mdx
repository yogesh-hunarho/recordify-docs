To begin the troubleshooting process:

2. This will generate a package containing:
   - System configuration details
   - Video recording data
3. The file size is approximately your video lenght


## Submitting Data for Analysis

After downloading the diagnostic package:

1. Send the file as an email attachment to [support@hunarho.com](mailto:support@hunarho.com)
2. Include any relevant details about:
   - When the issue occurred
   - What you were trying to record
   - Any error messages you saw

Our team will use this data to:
- Diagnose problems with the extension
- Attempt to recover your video if possible
- Provide solutions for the issues you're experiencing

## Automatic Upload to AWS S3

Note: Some videos are automatically uploaded to our AWS S3 storage. If you see the message "This video already uploaded to Hunarho", it means we may already have your recording in our systems.
