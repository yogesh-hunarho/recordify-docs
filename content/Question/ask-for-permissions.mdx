# Why Does Recordify Ask for Permissions?

To record your screen, **Recordify** requires a few necessary permissions from your browser.

---

## 📥 Install Permissions

- **"Read and change all your data on all websites"**  
  This is required to show the Recordify popup, enable screen annotations, control the toolbar, access your camera, and more — all within the pages you choose to record.  
  > 🛡️ Don’t worry — Recordify does **not collect or store any data**.

- **"Manage your downloads"**  
  This helps Recordify download your recorded videos smoothly once recording ends.

## 🎥 Record Permissions

When you click **“Start recording”** for the very first time, you’ll be prompted with another permission modal:

![Screen recording permission modal](/images/extension/permission.png)

- **"Capture content of your screen"**  
  This is required so Recordify can access your screen and begin the recording process.

That’s it! These permissions are minimal and only used to provide core features of the extension.
