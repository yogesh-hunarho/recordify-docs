# How to use and set keyboard shortcuts

To control extensions more conveniently, you can use keyboard shortcuts.


## How to view your shortcuts in Chrome

You can see all your available shortcuts by pasting `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` on your address bar and visiting the page.

Extensions have a limit of 4 global shortcuts, so you can set shortcuts for:

{/* - **Activate the extension.**  
  This toggles the extensions popup, so you don’t need to click on the icon to open it every time.  
  _Default:_ `Alt+Shift+X` or `Option+Shift+X` on Mac */}

- **Cancel recording.**  
  Use this shortcut to dismiss a recording without clicking on the toolbar.  
  _Default:_ `Alt+Shift+X` or `Option+Shift+X` on Mac

- **Pause/Resume recording.**  
  Allows you to pause and resume a recording in progress.  
  _Default:_ `Alt+Shift+M` or `Option+Shift+M` on Mac

- **Start recording.**  
  Starts a new recording with the last settings you used.  
  _Default:_ `Alt+Shift+G` or `Option+Shift+G` on Mac.  
  You can also see which shortcut is set next to the recording button in the popup.

> ❗ If you selected the Camera tab in the popup beforehand, and have no camera available, extensions won’t be able to start recording automatically.  
> _You might also have to select what you want to record in a modal._

## How to set or edit your shortcuts in Chrome

To set a shortcut, simply click on the pencil icon, and press the keys you’d like to use.

You can also switch whether a shortcut will work from anywhere, or from Chrome only.
